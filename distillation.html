          <h2>Introduction</h2>

          <p>
            Knowledge Distillation is a technique designed to transfer the
            "knowledge" or learned generalization capabilities from a large,
            complex, but potentially slow and resource-intensive "teacher" model
            (such as an ensemble or a heavily regularized network) to a smaller,
            faster "student" model suitable for deployment. The foundational
            idea, explored by
            <a href="#bucila-2006">Bucila et al. (2006) [1]</a>, involved
            training the student model to mimic the input-output function of the
            teacher by using the teacher to label a large set of unlabeled or
            synthetically generated "pseudo-data."
            <a href="#hinton-2015">Hinton et al. [2]</a> refined and popularized
            this concept for deep learning by proposing the use of the teacher's
            full output probability distribution (the "soft targets") rather
            than just the final prediction. These soft targets, often further
            softened using a "temperature" parameter, contain richer information
            about the similarities the teacher model has learned between classes
            (termed "dark knowledge"). By training the student to match these
            soft targets (often in combination with the original hard labels),
            the goal is to enable the compact student model to learn to
            generalize in a similar, effective way as the cumbersome teacher
            <a href="#hinton-2015">([2])</a>, thus bridging the gap between
            model performance and deployment practicality.

              >The experiment</a
            >
            systematically investigates and compares the effectiveness of
            different neural network architectures and specific model
            compression techniques on the MNIST handwritten digit classification
            task. Initially, it establishes performance benchmarks by defining
            and training baseline models of varying complexity – Multi-Layer
            Perceptrons (MLPs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and
            Residual Networks (ResNets), each with 'Simple', 'Medium', and
            'Deep' variants. This provides baseline accuracy and model size
            metrics for each architecture.
          </p>

          <p>
            The experiment then focuses on applying and evaluating two common
            model compression methods: dynamic quantization (reducing the
            precision of model weights) and knowledge distillation (training
            smaller 'student' models using guidance from larger, pre-trained
            'teacher' models). Each baseline model is subjected to these
            techniques, and the resulting compressed models are evaluated for
            their final accuracy and size. The experiment carefully tracks
            metrics and utilizes visualizations to compare the trade-offs
            between model accuracy and size across the different architectures
            and the applied compression strategies, aiming to demonstrate how
            quantization and distillation can create smaller, more efficient
            models while potentially preserving performance.

            This is the glass half full perspective of knowledge distillation.
            We can think of it as strictly improving our models using the
            knowledge of more complex models.

          <p>
            But we can also think of it as accepting a downgrade in performance
            from the larger models.

          <div style="display: flex">

            />
          </div>
          <p>
            We also compared the impact of other compression techniques with the
            same framework. Pruning led to a huge drop in accuracy. Quantization
            on the other hand had no drop in accuracy and reduced the size of
            the models to 25% of the original.
          </p>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Unlike quantization, which is restricted to a 25% reduction in size,
            based on the architecture of the student model, we can compress our
            models by an orders of magnitude. Moreover, the idea unlocks many
            new ways to learn like self-distillation, cross-modal, data-free,
            multi-teacher, automated, adversarial and many more forms of
            knowledge distillation.
